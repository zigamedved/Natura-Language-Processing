# Natural-Language-Processing

- For the second assignment in the Intelligent Systems course, our task was to create a 
program for the recognition of fake news articles. 
- We will tackle this problem using 
machine learning (ML) algorithms. These are algorithms that can improve automatically 
through experience and by the use of data. They build a model based on sample data, 
known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly 
programmed to do so. 
- They are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, 
email filtering, speech recognition, and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible 
to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks. 
- This property makes ML 
the perfect tool for our work on the second assignment, as it would be impossible to hardcode a solution that would accurately detect all(or even most) fake news articles.

There are 2 files in this repo, I would advise you to first check the ipynb and then if you want to change the code, use the other file as a starting point.
